Working for a tech company, I've been slowly familiarized with web 3 ecosystems. That's crypto, nft, metaverse, defi, dapps, DAO etc. Basically, hype tech.

If you are wondering why it all blew up it's because Ethereum enabled blockchain technology to be used in more ways than just transactions and fintech. It paved the way for decentralized applications(Dapps) through the use of smart contracts. Then comes decentralized finance, decentralized exchanges, and of course NFT. Not to mention Facebook rebranded to META pushing the narrative of metaverse future.

A slight tangent, metaverse is linked to blockchain because the assets and currencies used within metaverse can be represented with nfts and crypto tokens.

Web 3 was HYPE. Like REAL HYPE. Maybe some of you remember the good old days when every crypto was pumping and NFTs were going crazy. But well, nowadays things slowed down a bit and AI is the big hype. Nevertheless, personally I think Web 3 is here to stay. It's good tech, and good tech will stay. (I'm glossing over scams and scandals, obvs those exist too)

Now, what I wanted to actually share is this:
A bunch of "Startups" who don't understand the tech and the ecosystems are trying to capitalise on the whole hype by building honestly piles of rubbish and try to convince investors that they are gonna take off to the moon. Now _some_ investors just throw their money cause they believe in the hype and growth potential. I have talked to soooo many "leaders" that boast their metaverse project, Defi project, Nft or whatever and they DO NOT UNDERSTAND the whole point of Web 3.

They build MLM and pyramid schemes, mediocre exchanges that does nothing more than just basic buy and sell, shittier decentraland copycat, bla bla bla.

Like this people are just trying to grab your money and run. It's all a rug pull. They have no interest in the tech and what value the tech brings.They bring bad reputation to Web 3 and Defi, and for that I truly despise them.

I'll do another sharing on why Web 3 is good tech and why it does not deserve the hate that it receives.

Stay informed, don't be scammed.
